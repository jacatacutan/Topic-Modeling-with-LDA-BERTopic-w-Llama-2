This repository contains the technical report and supplementary notebooks for the study titled "The Role of Topic Modeling in Exploring Student Engagement and Curriculum Relevance During the Pandemic." The study investigates topic modeling using LDA and BERTopic, providing a comparative analysis of the two. It also provides example utlization of traditional natural language processing techniques like stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal.

## Abstract
Topic modeling is a powerful tool for extracting themes from large text corpora, and this study explores the application of two prominent methods: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic. Using an academic learning platform as a case study, our analysis reveals that LDA effectively captures broad and overlapping topics, reflecting the diverse subjects registered within the platform. However, this method also exhibits limitations, such as the tendency for topics to overlap due to dimensionality reduction distortions. In contrast, BERTopic demonstrates its strength in capturing nuanced themes through its integration with contextual embeddings and clustering techniques, allowing for better interpretability and coherence. Despite BERTopic’s versatility, LDA remains a viable option for simpler tasks, particularly when ease of use and established methods are prioritized. Our findings highlight the importance of thorough text preprocessing and underscore the need for hyperparameter tuning in BERTopic and grid search optimization for LDA. Future directions include enhancing BERTopic’s performance through hyperparameter adjustments and optimizing LDA’s Dirichlet priors to improve topic granularity and interpretability
